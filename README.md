Don't try to make sense of this one, even I don't remember which files do what anymore. This is a complete dump of all of the files I had for an ersatz telnet server and client with in-built flaws that left them open to exploitation, along with some shellcode custom designed just for the server and client, and a version of the server and client with necessary protections built in to mitigate the risk stack overflow attacks. The files and directory structure are as I found them on my old computer, and pretty obviously the result of me working under a really tight deadline at the time, and with a fair bit of trial and error while I was at it, too.
